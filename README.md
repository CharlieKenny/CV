## Charlie Kenny

I’m a highly motivated and enthusiastic individual who is passionate about beautiful code, design and all things tech. I most recently worked as Acting Global Account Manager at JWT London, WPP’s flagship advertising agency where I helped a number of blue chip technology companies, including Microsoft and Nokia, launch new products and services on an international stage. 

Through a lust for tech and a desire to learn more about how software works, I have just completed a 3-month intensive development bootcamp at Makers Academy.

To sate my appetite for technology and build on my background of tech product strategy and advertising I'm now looking to move into software development, full-time.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can continue to learn, build on the agile and extreme programming (XP) best practices I know and have come to love and contribute to exciting live production projects.

## Skills

#### Full Stack Developer

I have learnt how to build end-to-end desktop and mobile responsive web apps using Ruby (Ruby-on-Rails), most notably [Stitch](http://stitchvid.herokuapp.com/), a fully responsive app that allows users to take create aggregated visual narratives out of individual, crowdsourced videos uploaded on-the-go.

Over the past 12 weeks I've become comfortable, in and see the value of, using git and Github for version control and team-working purposes. It's proved to be a vital tool in maintaining an agile workflow.

Having had it instilled in me since day one of my coding journey, TDD has now become a habitual way of tackling any project and I'm comfortable using various testing frameworks (Rspec, Capybara, Jasmine and Protractor). This is true for a number of different methodologies that aid in crafting readable, maintainable code: pair programming, OOP, SOLID, MVC, BDD, EDUF.

#### Communication

At JWT I learnt how to quickly build rapport and the trust of both the clients and those that I worked with. I learnt how to communicate to people at all levels of an organisation to derive the greatest possible results. On a daily basis I would brief in new creative teams and aligning their talents with the clients' vision required a great deal of diplomacy and tact.
The same goes for presenting back creative work to senior clients and managing their expectations.

I'm looking forward to using these communication skills to talk about something I'm passionate about and have had a part in creating.
